@chapter Introduction

jabber.el is a Jabber client running under Emacs.  For more
information on the open-protocol instant messaging network Jabber,
please visit @uref{http://www.jabber.org}.

As a Jabber client, jabber.el is mostly just a face in the crowd,
except that it uses buffers where GUI clients have windows.  There is
a roster buffer, and to chat with someone you open a chat buffer, and
there are browse buffers (increasingly inexactly named) for
interaction with servers and services.  Then again, jabber.el delivers
excellent console performance and customizable hooks (if you have
speech synthesizer software, hook it up to your presence alerts).

jabber.el does not yet support GPG, sending and receiving
roster items, and various other things.

@chapter Basic operation

This chapter is intended as an introduction to basic usage of
jabber.el.  If you have used Jabber before and are familiar with the
terminology, you might find it a bit too basic --- in that case, just
skim it, making sure to pick up the commands mentioned.

There are a handful of global keybindings for common commands.  They
start with @kbd{C-x C-j}, and you can get a list of them by typing
@kbd{C-x C-j C-h}.

@section Connecting

@findex jabber-connect
@findex jabber-disconnect

@cindex Connecting
@cindex Registering an account

I'll assume that you have already successfully installed jabber.el; if
not, consult the @file{README} file.  Also, make sure you have
@code{(require 'jabber)} in your @file{.emacs}.

Now, type @kbd{M-x jabber-customize}.  This brings up a customize
buffer for jabber.el.  The most important variables to customize are
@code{jabber-username} and
@code{jabber-server}.@footnote{@xref{Connection settings}, for other
things you might have to change.}  Save your changes, and type
@kbd{M-x jabber-connect} to connect.

If you do not yet have a Jabber account, you can register one.  Enter
your desired username for @code{jabber-username} and the server you wish
to use for @code{jabber-server}, save, and type @kbd{C-u M-x
jabber-connect} or @kbd{C-u C-x C-j C-c}.  If the server supports
in-band registration, you will be presented with a registration form to
fill out and send.  There the username you chose will be prefilled.
Don't change it, otherwise jabber.el will be confused.

If you successfully connect, jabber.el will download your roster and
display it in a buffer called @code{*-jabber-*}.

By default, you will appear as ``online'' to your contacts.  To change
this to e.g. ``away'', type @kbd{M-x jabber-send-presence} or @kbd{C-x
C-j C-p}.  @xref{Presence}, for more information.

To disconnect, type @kbd{M-x jabber-disconnect} or @kbd{C-x C-j C-d}.

@node Chatting, Presence, Connecting, Basic operation
@section Chatting

@cindex Chatting
@findex jabber-chat-with

There are several ways to open a chat buffer.  The shortest way is to
put point over the person you want to chat with in the roster display
and hit RET.

You can also use menus to access commands.  In the roster display, you
can access several menus through keystrokes or mouse clicks.  You can
bring one big menu up by pressing the second mouse button, or you can
bring up the ``chat menu'' by typing @kbd{C-c C-c}.  If you do the
latter while point is on a roster entry, that entry will be the
default value when you are asked for whom to chat with.

You can also use the function @code{jabber-chat-with}, which is what the
menu item is bound to.  This function is bound to @kbd{C-x C-j C-j} in
the global keymap.

Now, try opening a chat with someone.  A buffer named
@code{*-jabber-chat-:-@var{person}-*} will be created and selected.
Type your message at the end of the buffer, and hit @kbd{RET} to send
it.  To include a newline in your message, use @kbd{C-j}.

@node Presence, Presence subscription, Chatting, Basic operation
@section Presence

@cindex Presence
@cindex Sending presence
@findex jabber-send-presence
@findex jabber-send-default-presence
@vindex jabber-default-show
@vindex jabber-default-status
@vindex jabber-default-priority

``Presence'' is the Jabber term for letting other people know that you
are online, and additionally how ``available'' you are.  There are
three elements to presence: availability status (called ``show''),
status message, and priority.

Your show status may either be empty (meaning simply ``online''), or
one of @code{away}, @code{xa}, @code{dnd} and @code{chat}, meaning
``away'', ``extended away'' (i.e. away for an extended period), ``do
not disturb'', and ``free for chat'', respectively.  This information
is available to everyone subscribing to your presence, but technically
it does not restrict anyone's actions.  You can chat with people even
if you claim to be away.

The status message is a short text complementing your show status,
such as ``at home'', ``working'', ``phone'', ``playing games'' or
whatever you want.  It is sent to everyone subscribing to your
presence, but not all clients prominently display it to the user.

The priority is only interesting if you are running more than one
Jabber client at a time accessing the same account.  In that case,
messages sent to you without an indication of which client to send to
are sent to the client with the highest priority.

To set your presence, use the function @code{jabber-send-presence}.
It can be called both interactively and in Lisp code.  For the latter
case, use something like @code{(jabber-send-presence "away" "idle for
10 minutes" 10)}.

By default, jabber.el sets your presence when you connect.  If you
want it not to do that, remove @code{jabber-send-default-presence}
from @code{jabber-post-connect-hook}.  If you want to change the
presence that is sent, change the variables
@code{jabber-default-show}, @code{jabber-default-status} and
@code{jabber-default-priority}.

With jabber.el, you can set your presence remotely.  @xref{Ad-Hoc Commands}.

@cindex directed presence
@cindex send directed presence
@findex jabber-send-directed-presence
You can send ``directed presence'' with @kbd{M-x
jabber-send-directed-presence}.  This is mostly useful to manage
transports---sending directed presence is a way to turn them on and
off.  You can also send directed presence to an annoying contact to
appear as away or offline to that contact.  Note, however, that in both
of these cases, all subscribed entities will get your next global
presence update.

@node Presence subscription, Roster buffer, Presence, Basic operation
@section Presence subscription

@cindex Presence subscription
@cindex Subscribing to someone's presence
@findex jabber-send-subscription-request

Having permission to view the presence status of a person is called
@dfn{subscribing to his presence}.  Presence subscription between two
persons can be asymmetric.

When jabber.el receives a presence subscription request, it will
present it to you in an alert requiring immediate response, and offer
you to send a subscription request back to that person.

To request subscription to someone, type @kbd{M-x
jabber-send-subscription-request}.  You will be prompted for the JID
to send it to.  This command can also be accessed through the Roster
menu, by typing @kbd{C-c C-r} in the roster buffer.  After that, you
will probably want to give the contact a more readable name.  The
command for that is @code{jabber-roster-change}, which is also
available in the Roster menu or by typing @kbd{e} on a person in the
roster buffer.

@node Roster buffer,  , Presence subscription, Basic operation
@section The roster buffer

@cindex Roster buffer, basics
@cindex Menus
@cindex Key bindings
@findex jabber-display-roster

The roster buffer is called @code{*-jabber-*}.  It simply contains a
list of the contacts on your roster.

In the roster buffer, any command which requires a JID will default to
the JID under point when called.  These commands can be called through
either keyboard menus or mouse menus.  To open a menu with the mouse,
simply press the second mouse button over the JID in
question.@footnote{For some reason, mouse menus don't work in XEmacs.
Patches welcome.}  This will bring up a menu with all available
actions.  The keyboard menus are split into categories: Chat, Roster,
Information, MUC (Multi-User Chat, or groupchat) and Services, opened
by @kbd{C-c C-c}, @kbd{C-c C-r}, @kbd{C-c C-i}, @kbd{C-c C-m} and
@kbd{C-c C-s}, respectively.

A list of keybindings is displayed at the top of the roster buffer.
You can turn it off by setting @code{jabber-roster-show-bindings} to
nil.

You can call @code{jabber-display-roster} to redisplay your roster
according to changed preferences (@pxref{Customizing the roster
buffer}).  This will not refetch your roster from the server.
Refetching the roster is usually not needed, since updates are pushed
to clients automatically.

You can choose not to have the roster updated automatically on
presence changes (@pxref{Presence alerts}).  In that case, you need to
call @code{jabber-display-roster} manually.

@node Groupchat, Composing messages, Basic operation, Top
@chapter Groupchat

@cindex Groupchat
@cindex MUC
@cindex Chatrooms

The groupchat menu can be accessed by typing @kbd{C-c C-m} in the
roster buffer.  You can also type the commands directly, as will be
shown here.

@findex jabber-groupchat-join
@cindex Joining a groupchat
@cindex Changing nickname
@cindex Nickname, changing 
To join a groupchat, type @kbd{M-x jabber-groupchat-join}.  You will
be prompted for the groupchat to join, and your nickname in the
groupchat.  This nickname doesn't need to have any correlation to your
JID; in fact, groupchats are usually (but not always) configured such
that only moderators can see your JID.  You can change your nickname
with @kbd{M-x jabber-muc-nick}.  @xref{Automation}, for setting default 
nicknames.

@cindex query groupchat
@vindex jabber-muc-disable-disco-check
When trying to join a room, jabber.el first sends a service discovery
info request to the room, to find out whether it exists and what
features are enabled (in particular whether the room is
password-protected).  However, this can cause problems with some buggy
MUC services (or services that respond in a way that jabber.el doesn't
expect).  A workaround for that is to set
@code{jabber-muc-disable-disco-check} to t; however, the bug should be
unearthed and fixed.

Groupchat messages will be displayed in a buffer called
@code{*-jabber-groupchat-:-@var{groupchat}-*}.  It works much like the
chat buffer.

@cindex Topic, MUC
@findex jabber-muc-set-topic
To change the topic of a groupchat, type @kbd{M-x jabber-muc-set-topic}.
The current topic is shown in the header line.

@findex jabber-groupchat-leave
To leave a groupchat, type @kbd{M-x jabber-groupchat-leave}.

@findex jabber-groupchat-get-config
If you are the owner of a groupchat, you can change its configuration
by typing @kbd{M-x jabber-groupchat-get-config}.  A configuration form
will be rendered in new buffer.

@findex jabber-muc-names
To see which people are in a groupchat, type @kbd{M-x
jabber-muc-names}.  This gives a list of nicknames, ``roles'',
``affiliations'', and possibly JIDs.  @xref{MUC Administration}, for
the meaning of roles and affiliations.

Additionally, you can set different nicknames for different groups, by
customizing @code{jabber-muc-default-nicknames}.  There you specify
the JID of the group, and your preferred nickname.

If you want to automatically join certain rooms when connecting, you
can set @code{jabber-muc-autojoin} to a list containing the JIDs of
the rooms you want to enter.  To disable this feature, remove
@code{jabber-muc-autojoin} from @code{jabber-post-connect-hook}.

@node Invitations, Private messages, Automation, Groupchat

@cindex Invitations
@findex jabber-muc-invite

You can invite someone to a groupchat with @kbd{M-x jabber-muc-invite}
(also available in the MUC menu).  Pay attention to the order of the
arguments --- as both users and rooms are just JIDs, it is technically
possible to invite a room to a user, but that's probably not what you
want.

When you receive an invitation, it appears in the chat buffer along
with two buttons, ``Accept'' and ``Decline''.  Pressing ``Accept''
enters the room, as you would expect.  Pressing ``Decline'' gives you
an opportunity to state the reason why you're not joining.

@node Private messages, MUC Administration, Invitations, Groupchat
@section Private messages

@cindex Private MUC messages
@findex jabber-muc-private

You can open a private chat with a participant in a chat room with
@kbd{M-x jabber-muc-private} (or by using the MUC menu).  This creates
a buffer with the name
@code{*-jabber-muc-priv-@var{group}-@var{nickname}-*} (customizable by
@code{jabber-muc-private-buffer-format}), which behaves mostly like an
ordinary chat buffer.  This buffer will also be created if someone
sends a private message to you.

Private MUC messages use the same alerts as normal chat messages.
@xref{Message alerts}.

@node MUC Administration,  , Private messages, Groupchat
@section Administration

Administration of a MUC room mostly consists of managing roles and
affiliations.  Roles are temporary, and apply until the user leaves the
room.  Affiliations are permanent, and based on JIDs.

@subsection Roles

@findex jabber-muc-set-role
@cindex Kicking, MUC
@cindex Voice, MUC
@cindex Moderator, MUC
@cindex Roles, MUC
If you have moderator privileges, you can change the role of a
participant with @kbd{M-x jabber-muc-set-role}.  Kicking means setting
the role to ``none''.  Granting and revoking voice are ``participant''
and ``visitor'', respectively.  ``moderator'' gives moderator
privileges, obviously.

The possible roles are:

@table @samp
@item moderator
Has voice, can change other people's roles.

@item participant
Has voice.

@item visitor
Doesn't have voice (can't send messages to everyone, but can send
private messages)

@item none
Not in room.
@end table

@subsection Affiliations

@findex jabber-muc-set-affiliation
@cindex Affiliations, MUC
@cindex Banning, MUC
If you have admin or owner privileges, you can change the affiliation of
a user with @kbd{M-x jabber-muc-set-affiliation}.  Affiliation is
persistent, and based on JIDs.  Depending of your affiliation and the
MUC implementation, you might not be allowed to perform all kinds of
changes, and maybe not in one step.

Affiliations are:

@table @samp
@item owner
Can destroy room, appoint admins, make people members, ban people.

@item admin
Can make people members or ban people.

@item member
Can enter the room, and has voice by default.

@item none
Rights depend on room configuration.  The room might be members-only, or
grant voice only to members.

@item outcast
Banned from the room
@end table

@chapter Composing messages

@findex jabber-compose
@cindex composing messages
@cindex message composition

The chat buffer interface can be inconvenient for some purposes.  As you
can't use @kbd{RET} to insert a newline (use @kbd{C-j} for that),
writing a longer message can be painful.  Also, it is not possible to
include a subject in the message, or send the message to multiple
recipients.

These features are implemented by the message composing tool.  Type
@kbd{M-x jabber-compose} to start it.  In the buffer that comes up, you
can specify recipients, enter a subject, and type your message.

@node File transfer, Services, Composing messages, Top
@chapter File transfer

@cindex File transfer
@cindex Sending files

jabber.el has limited support for file transfer.  The most important
limit is that files sent and received are kept in buffers, so Emacs must
be able to allocate enough memory for the entire file, and the file size
must be smaller than the maximum buffer size.@footnote{The maximum
buffer size is kept in the variable @code{most-positive-fixnum}.  On
most 32-bit systems, this is 128 or 256 megabytes, depending on your
Emacs version.}

jabber.el is able to exchange files with most Jabber clients (and also
some MSN transports), but notably not with the official Google Talk
client.  The Google Talk client uses a different file transfer protocol
that, at the time of this release, has not been published.

@menu

* Sending files::               
@end menu

@node Receiving files, Sending files, File transfer, File transfer
@section Receiving files

Receiving files requires no configuration.  When someone wants to send a
file to you, you are asked (through @code{yes-or-no-p}) whether you want
to accept the file.  If you answer yes, you get to choose where to save
the file.

If the sender's client is correctly configured (this is often not the
case; see below), the file transfer will start.  Currently, the only way
to watch the progress is to inspect the buffer of the file being
transfered; @kbd{C-x C-b} is one way of doing that.  @xref{List Buffers,
, Listing Existing Buffers, emacs, GNU Emacs Manual}.  When the transfer
is done, the message ``@var{file} downloaded'' appears in the echo area,
and the buffer is killed.

If this doesn't happen, it is most likely the sender's fault.  The
sender needs to have a public IP address, either directly, through port
forwarding (in which case the client needs to be configured with the
real public IP address), or through an XEP-0065 proxy.  If you have
activated XML logging (@pxref{Debug options}), you can see the IP
address that the other client is asking you to connect to there.  Often
you will find that this is an internal IP address (often starts with
@code{192.168}).  See the documentation of the sender's client for
setting this up.

@node Sending files,  , Receiving files, File transfer
@section Sending files

@cindex proxy, file transfer
@cindex file transfer proxy
@cindex XEP-0065 proxy

To send a file to someone, you need an XEP-0065 proxy.@footnote{This
requirement is not inherent in the protocol, only in the current file
transfer implementation of jabber.el, and in Emacs versions earlier than
22.}  If your Jabber server hosts such a proxy, it will be found
automatically, otherwise it needs to be manually configured.

You can check whether your Jabber server has a proxy with @kbd{M-x
jabber-get-disco-items}; see @ref{Service discovery and browsing}.

@vindex jabber-socks5-proxies
@findex jabber-socks5-query-all-proxies
To configure a proxy manually, customize the variable
@code{jabber-socks5-proxies}.  Putting @code{proxy.jabber.se} there
should work.  Type @kbd{M-x jabber-socks5-query-all-proxies} to see if
the proxies answer.

@findex jabber-ft-send
Now, you can type @kbd{M-x jabber-ft-send} to send a file to someone.
You need to enter the correct full JID, including resource, to get this
right.  If the contact is logged in with only one client, and you can
see it online, just typing the JID or roster name is enough.  If you run
the command from a chat buffer, the JID of the contact is given as
the default value.

If the contact has several clients online, you probably want to send the
file to a particular one.  If you run this command from within a chat
buffer, the default target will be the one that last sent a message to
you.  If you just type a bare JID or a roster name, the client with the
highest priority will get the file.

If the contact accepts the file, and the contact's client succeeds in
connecting to the proxy, jabber.el will send the file through the
proxy.  During this time, your Emacs will be blocked, so you might want
to avoid sending large files over slow connections.

@cindex Browse buffers

Not every Jabber entity is a physical person.  There are many
automatic entities, called servers, services, components, agents,
transports and other names.  The use of these is described here.

The functions described in this chapter use @dfn{browse buffers}.
Browse buffers are named @code{*-jabber-browse-:-@var{service}-*},
sometimes with a numerical suffix.  The different menus have the same
keybindings as in the roster buffer, and if you call a function
operating on a JID while point is over a JID, that JID will be the
default value, so you don't have to type it or copy it yourself.

@cindex Service discovery
@cindex Browsing
@findex jabber-get-browse
@findex jabber-get-disco-items
@findex jabber-get-disco-info

To find services you want to use, you need to discover them first.
This can be done with either service discovery or browsing.  Service
discovery is the newer and preferred protocol, while browsing is still
used by much software.  The use of both is very similar.

The most common use of service discovery is to browse your home
server, to see what services are provided locally.  Note, however,
that this is no restriction; you can use services from all over the
network.

For service discovery there are two commands,
@code{jabber-get-disco-items} and @code{jabber-get-disco-info},
depending on whether you want information about that specific JID or
about services related to it, respectively.  To start browsing, type
@kbd{M-x jabber-get-browse} and enter the JID you want to browse.

These commands can be accessed from the Info menu, which is opened by
typing @kbd{C-c C-i}.

If you think that the interface to service discovery is awkward and
should be replaced with something better, you are completely right.

@cindex Registration

@findex jabber-get-register

Some services, in particular user directories and gateways to legacy
IM systems, require registration.  To register with such a service,
either type @kbd{M-x jabber-get-register} or select it from the
Service menu, which is opened by typing @kbd{C-c C-s}.  You have to
know the service's JID, possibly from service discovery.
(@pxref{Service discovery and browsing})

This is also the way to change your registration details, e.g. your
password --- just ask to register with that service again.  To change
the password of your Jabber account, ask to register with your Jabber
server.

Please note that any passwords sent in this way will be sent in
cleartext to your Jabber server, unless you have enabled SSL encryption
(@pxref{Connection settings}), and possibly sent in cleartext from your
server to the server hosting the service.

jabber.el will then request a registration form from that service.  If
for some reason the service does not answer (maybe network problems,
or some services neither support registration nor report errors about
that) that will be the last thing you saw about it.  jabber.el will
not report timeout errors, but rather simply wait until you shut it
down.

Once the response arrives, the form will be rendered in a browse
buffer.  Just fill out the fields, and hit Submit.  You will receive
confirmation of your registration in the echo area.

To cancel an existing registration (and also for cancelling your
Jabber account, if you sent a registration request to your server),
hit Cancel.  The unregistration will be confirmed in the echo area.

@findex jabber-get-search

Some services, notably user directories and gateways to legacy IM
systems, allow searching.  Searching in Jabber generally means
searching for someone's JID, but the protocol is general enough to
support most databases.

To search a service, either type @kbd{M-x jabber-get-search} or select
it from the Service menu, which is opened by typing @kbd{C-c C-s}.

Just like with registration, this command sends a request for a search
form, and displays it if and when the response arrives.  Enter your
search and submit it.  Search results will be displayed in a different
browse buffer.

@findex jabber-ahc-get-list
@findex jabber-ahc-execute-command

jabber.el supports a subset of XEP-0050, the standard for Ad-Hoc
Commands.  As the name implies, this can be used for just about
anything.  It has been used for remote-controlling clients (e.g. Psi),
and administering services (e.g. PyMSNt).

Currently, jabber.el uses ad-hoc commands for setting presence remotely.
If you realize that you forgot to set your client to ``away'' with a low
priority, you can do it remotely.@footnote{Most Jabber servers also
support kicking a client off the net by logging in with another client
with exactly the same resource.}

The commands for executing ad-hoc commands are available under the
Service menu, which is opened by typing @kbd{C-c C-s}.

To find which commands are available, run ``Request command-list''
(@code{jabber-ahc-get-list}).@footnote{This is the same thing as a
disco items request to the node
@code{http://jabber.org/protocol/commands}.}

To run a command from the list, put point over it and run ``Execute
command'' (@code{jabber-ahc-execute-command}), accepting the defaults
for JID and node.  (If you already know those, you could of course
enter them yourself)  The form you get should hopefully be
self-explanatory.

@cindex vCard
@cindex Personal information
@findex jabber-vcard-get
@findex jabber-vcard-edit

The Jabber way of handling personal information (name, addresses,
phone numbers, etc) is ``vCards'' encoded in XML.  You can get
information about a user by running @kbd{M-x jabber-vcard-get}, and
you can edit your own information by running @kbd{M-x
jabber-vcard-edit}.

The form for editing your information can be slightly confusing ---
you are allowed to enter any number of addresses, phone numbers and
e-mail addresses, each of which has a set of orthogonal properties.
You can add and remove items with the [INS] and [DEL] buttons,
respectively.

This is also where you set your avatar (@pxref{Avatars}).  The size of
your avatar file is limited to 8 kilobytes.

@cindex avatars
@vindex jabber-vcard-avatars-retrieve
@vindex jabber-vcard-avatars-publish
@vindex jabber-avatar-cache-directory

jabber.el supports viewing and publishing avatars according to XEP-0153,
vCard-Based Avatars.  By default, if you have an avatar in your vCard
(@pxref{Personal information}), it will be published for others to see,
and if other people publish their avatars, they will be displayed in the
roster buffer and in the header line of chat buffers, assuming that your
Emacs can display images.

To disable retrieval of other people's avatars, set
@code{jabber-vcard-avatars-retrieve} to nil.  To disable publishing of
your own avatar, set @code{jabber-vcard-avatars-publish} to nil.

Avatars are cached in the directory specified by
@code{jabber-avatar-cache-directory}, by default
@file{~/.jabber-avatars/}.  The cache is never cleaned, so you might
want to do that yourself from time to time.

@section Autoaway

@cindex autoaway
@cindex idle
@cindex xprintidle
@vindex jabber-autoaway-method

It is possible to automatically set your status to ``away'' when you
haven't used your computer for a while.  This lets your contacts know
that you might not answer immediately.

To activate this feature, add @code{jabber-autoaway-start} to
@code{jabber-post-connect-hook}, e.g:
@example
(add-hook 'jabber-post-connect-hook 'jabber-autoaway-start)
@end example

There are different methods to find how long you have been ``idle''.
The method to use is specified by @code{jabber-autoaway-method}.  The
value of this variable should be a function that returns the number of
seconds you have been idle.  Three functions are provided.

If you are running Emacs 22 and thus have the @code{current-idle-time}
function, it is used by default.  Note that this method only measures
the time since you last interacted with Emacs, and thus disregards
activity in other programs.

If you are using the X Window System, you can use the
@uref{http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/~henoch/text/xprintidle.html,
xprintidle} program.  Make sure that @code{jabber-xprintidle-program} is
set to the correct file name.  This uses the same method as XScreensaver
to find your idle time.

If you are using Emacs on a GNU/Linux terminal, the function
@code{jabber-termatime-get-idle-time} is used by default.

@node Modeline status, Keepalive, Autoaway, Useful features
@section Modeline status

@cindex Modeline
@findex jabber-mode-line-mode
@vindex jabber-mode-line-mode
@vindex jabber-mode-line-compact

By typing @kbd{M-x jabber-mode-line-mode} you toggle display of some
status in mode lines.  The information is your own presence status,
and some numbers showing the status of your roster contacts.  By
default, there are three numbers, for ``online'' (chatty and online),
``away'' (away, extended away and do not disturb) and offline
contacts.

If you set @code{jabber-mode-line-compact} to nil, you get a complete
breakdown of presence status.  That gives you six numbers indicating
the number of chatty, online, away, extended away, dnd, and offline
contacts, respectively.

@node Keepalive, Tracking activity, Modeline status, Useful features
@section Keepalive

@cindex Keepalive
@cindex Detecting lost connections
@findex jabber-keepalive-start
@findex jabber-keepalive-stop
@vindex jabber-keepalive-interval
@vindex jabber-keepalive-timeout

Sometimes network connections are lost without you noticing.  This is
especially true with Jabber, as it is quite reasonable to keep the
connection open for a long time without either sending or receiving
any data.

If you want to detect a lost connection earlier, you can use the
keepalive functions.  Type @kbd{M-x jabber-keepalive-start} to start
it, and @kbd{M-x jabber-keepalive-stop} to stop it.

These functions work by asking your server for the time once in a
while (by default every ten minutes), and considering the connection
lost if the server doesn't answer within reasonable time (by default
20 seconds).

You can customize the interval and the timeout with the variables
@code{jabber-keepalive-interval} and @code{jabber-keepalive-timeout},
respectively.

@vindex jabber-activity-query-unread
@vindex jabber-activity-count-in-title
@vindex jabber-activity-count-in-title-format

When you're working on something important you might want to delay
responding to incoming messages.  However, when you're done working,
will you remember them?  If you're anything like me, you'll have a lot
of buffers in your Emacs session, and a jabber chat buffer can easily
get lost.

When you type @kbd{M-x jabber-activity-mode} Emacs starts keeping
track of the buddies which have messaged you since last you visited
their buffer, and will display them in mode line.  As soon as you
visit their buffer they disappear from the mode line, indicating that
you've read their message.

If your mode line fills over because of these notifications, you can
customize @code{jabber-activity-make-strings} to shorten them to the
shortest possibly unambiguous form.

If you try to exit Emacs while you still have unread messages, you
will be notified and asked about this.  If you don't like that, set
@code{jabber-activity-query-unread} to nil.

If you want to display the number of unread buffers in the frame title,
set @code{jabber-activity-count-in-title} to t.  The format of the
number can be changed through
@code{jabber-activity-count-in-title-format}.

For complete customizability, write a hook function for
@code{jabber-activity-update-hook}.  From that function, you can take
action based on @code{jabber-activity-jids},
@code{jabber-activity-mode-string}, and
@code{jabber-activity-count-string}.

@node Watch buddies, Spell checking, Tracking activity, Useful features

Sometimes you might be waiting for a certain person to come online,
and you don't want that occasion to get lost in the noise.  To get an
obtrusive message when that happens, type @kbd{M-x jabber-watch-add}
and select the person in question.  You can enter a comment, to
remember why you added the watch.

You will get a message whenever that person goes from offline to
online.  jabber.el will remember this for the rest of your Emacs
session (it's not saved to disk, though), but if you want to get rid
of it, type @kbd{M-x jabber-watch-remove}.

You can activate spell checking in a chat buffer with @kbd{M-x

@vindex jabber-history-size-limit
@vindex jabber-backlog-number
@vindex jabber-backlog-days

If you want a record of messages sent and received, set
@code{jabber-history-enabled} to t.  By default all messages to will
be saved to a global history file specified by
@code{jabber-global-history-filename}
(@file{~/.jabber_global_message_log} by default).  If you prefer to
store your chats' history in per-contact files, you can set the
@code{jabber-use-global-history} variable to @code{nil}.  When using
per-contact history, files are named by the contact JID and saved
under the directory specified by the variable
@code{jabber-history-dir} (default is @file{~/.emacs-jabber}).

There is no facility for reading old messages yet, but just reading
the file as text should be enough for many purposes.

When you open a new chat buffer and have entries in your history file,
the last few messages you recently exchanged with the contact in
question will be inserted.  You can control how many messages with
@code{jabber-backlog-number} (by default 10), and how old messages
with @code{jabber-backlog-days} (by default 3 days).

If you worry about your history file(s) size, you can enable history
rotation feature by setting the variable
@code{jabber-history-enable-rotation} to @code{t} (default is
@code{nil}).  This feature ``rotates'' your history files according to
the following rule: When @code{jabber-history-size-limit} (in
kilobytes) is reached, the history file is renamed to
<history-file>-<number>, where <number> is 1 or the smallest number
after the last rotation.  For example, suppose you set the
@code{jabber-history-size-limit} variable to 512 and you chat with
your buddy foo@@jabber.server using the per-contact strategy to store
history files.  So, when the history file (@file{foo@@jabber-server})
reaches 512K bytes, it will be renamed to @file{foo@@jabber-server-1}
and @file{foo@@jabber-server} will be set empty. Next time
@file{foo@@jabber-server} grows to 512K bytes, it will be saved as
@file{foo@@jabber-server-2} and so on.  Although the example was
presented with the per-contact history file strategy, history rotation
works for both per-contact and global history logging strategies.

@cindex Import roster

Your roster is saved on the Jabber server, and usually not in the

The most common reason for this is probably to copy it to another
account.

To export your roster to a file, type @kbd{M-x jabber-export-roster}.
A buffer will appear in which you can edit the data to be exported.
Changes done in that buffer will not affect your real roster.

To import your roster from a file, type @kbd{M-x jabber-import-roster}.
You will be able to edit the data before importing it.  Items not in the
roster will be added; items in the roster will be modified to match
imported data.  Subscriptions will be updated.

the path of @file{xmppuri.sh}.  There are two ways to do this:

@itemize
@item
Go to the URL @samp{about:config}, right-click in the list, choose ``New
string'', and enter @samp{network.protocol-handler.app.xmpp} and the
path in the following dialogs.

@item
Open or create the file @file{user.js} in your Mozilla profile directory
(in the same directory as @file{prefs.js}), and add the following line:

@example
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.app.xmpp", "@var{/path/to}/xmppuri.sh");

When an event happens (currently including presence changes, incoming
messages, and completed queries) you will usually want to be
notified.  Since tastes in this area vary wildly, these alerts are
implemented as hooks, so you can choose which ones you want, or write
your own if none fit.

Actually, if you don't want to write your own, stop reading this
section and just read @ref{Standard alerts}.

Many kinds of alerts consist in displaying a text message through a
certain mechanism.  This text message is provided by a function which
you can rewrite or replace.  If this function returns @code{nil}, no
message is displayed, and non-textual alerts refrain from action.

If you want to write alert hooks that do nothing except displaying the
supplied message in some way, use the macro
@code{define-jabber-alert}.  For example, if @var{foo} is a function
that takes a string as an argument, write
@example
(define-jabber-alert foo
  "Display a message in a fooish way"
  'foo)
@end example
and all details will be taken care of for you.

The hooks take different arguments depending on category.  However,
they all have in common that the last argument is the result of the
message function.  The message function for each category takes the
same arguments as the corresponding hooks, except for that last
argument.

Alert hook contributions are very welcome.  You can send them to the
mailing list, or to the Sourceforge patch tracker.

Alert hooks are meant for optional UI things, that are subject to
varying user tastes, and that can be toggled by simply adding or
removing the function to and from the hook.  For other things, there
are corresponding general hooks, that are defvars instead of
defcustoms, and that are to be managed by Lisp code.  They have the
same name as the alert hooks minus the @code{-alert} part,
i.e. @code{jabber-message-hooks} vs @code{jabber-alert-message-hooks},
etc.

@subsection Standard alerts

@cindex Alerts
@cindex Scroll

Eight alerts are already written for all four alert categories.  These
all obey the result from the corresponding message function.

The @code{beep} alerts simply sound the terminal bell by calling
@code{ding}.  They are disabled by default.

The @code{echo} alerts display a message in the echo area by calling
@code{message}.  They are enabled by default.

The @code{switch} alerts switch to the buffer where the event occurred
(chat buffer for incoming messages, roster buffer for presence
changes, browse buffer for completed queries).  They are disabled by
default.  Take care when using them, as they may interrupt your
editing.

The @code{display} alerts display but do not select the buffer in
question, using the function @code{display-buffer}.  @xref{Choosing
Window, , Choosing a Window for Display, elisp, GNU Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual}, for information about customizing its behaviour.
This is enabled by default for info requests.

The @code{wave} alerts play a sound file by calling
@code{play-sound-file}.  No sound files are provided.  To use this,
enter the names of the sound files in
@code{jabber-alert-message-wave}, @code{jabber-alert-presence-wave}
and @code{jabber-alert-info-wave}, respectively.  You can specify
specific sound files for contacts matching a regexp in the variables
@code{jabber-alert-message-wave-alist} and
@code{jabber-alert-presence-wave-alist}.

The @code{screen} alerts send a message through the Screen terminal
manager (see @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/}).  They do no
harm if called when you don't use Screen.

The @code{ratpoison} alerts send a message through the Ratpoison
window manager (see @uref{http://ratpoison.sourceforge.net/}).  They
do no harm if used when you're not running X, but if you are running X
with another window manager, the ratpoison processes will never exit.
You can look at them with @code{list-processes}.

The @code{sawfish} alerts send a message through the Sawfish window
manager.

The @code{festival} alerts speak the message using the Emacs interface
of the Festival speech synthesis system (see
@uref{http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/}).

Additionally, for one-to-one and MUC messages, there are @code{scroll}
alerts (enabled by default), that aim to do the right thing with chat
buffers that are visible but not active.  Sometimes you want point to
scroll down, and sometimes not.  These functions should do what you
mean; if they don't, it's a bug.

Some of these functions are in the @file{jabber-alert.el} file, and the
others are in their own files.  You can use them as templates or
inspiration for your own alerts.

@node Presence alerts, Message alerts, Standard alerts, Customizing alerts
@subsection Presence alerts

@vindex jabber-alert-presence-message-function
@findex jabber-presence-default-message

Set @code{jabber-alert-presence-message-function} to your desired
function.  This function should look like:

@example
(defun @var{function} (@var{who} @var{oldstatus} @var{newstatus} @var{statustext})
   ...
   )
@end example

@var{who} is the JID symbol (@pxref{Roster structure}),
@var{oldstatus} and @var{newstatus} are the previous and current
stati, respectively, and @var{statustext} is the status message if
provided, otherwise nil.

@var{newstatus} can also be one of @code{"subscribe"},
@code{"subscribed"}, @code{"unsubscribe"} and @code{"unsubscribed"}.

The default function, @code{jabber-presence-default-message}, returns
@code{nil} if @var{oldstatus} and @var{newstatus} are the same, and in
other cases constructs a message from the given data.

All presence alert hooks take the same arguments plus the additional
@var{proposed-alert}, which is the result of the specified message
function.  This last argument is usually the only one they use.

@node Message alerts, MUC alerts, Presence alerts, Customizing alerts
@subsection Message alerts

@vindex jabber-alert-message-function
@findex jabber-message-default-message
@vindex jabber-message-alert-same-buffer

If you don't want message alerts when the chat buffer in question is
already the current buffer, set @code{jabber-message-alert-same-buffer}
to nil.  This affects the behaviour of the default message function, so
you'll have to reimplement this functionality if you write your own
message function.

Set @code{jabber-alert-message-function} to your desired
function.@footnote{Logically it should be
@code{jabber-alert-message-message-function}, but that would be
really ugly.}  This function should look like:

@example
(defun @var{function} (@var{from} @var{buffer} @var{text})
   ...
   )
@end example

@var{from} is the JID symbol (@pxref{Roster structure}), @var{buffer}
is the buffer where the message is displayed, and @var{text} is the
text of the message.

The default function, @code{jabber-message-default-message}, returns
``Message from @var{person}'', where @var{person} is the name of the
person if specified in the roster, otherwise the JID.

All message alert hooks take the same arguments plus the additional
@var{proposed-alert}, which is the result of the specified message
function.

@node MUC alerts, Info alerts, Message alerts, Customizing alerts
@subsection MUC alerts

@vindex jabber-alert-muc-function
@vindex jabber-muc-alert-self
@findex jabber-muc-default-message

Set @code{jabber-alert-muc-function} to your desired
function.  This function should look like:

@example
(defun @var{function} (@var{nick} @var{group} @var{buffer} @var{text})
   ...
   )
@end example

@var{nick} is the nickname, @var{group} is the JID of the group,
@var{buffer} is the buffer where the message is displayed, and
@var{text} is the text of the message.

The default function, @code{jabber-muc-default-message}, returns
``Message from @var{nick} in @var{group}'' or ``Message in
@var{group}'', the latter for messages from the room itself.

All MUC alert hooks take the same arguments plus the additional
@var{proposed-alert}, which is the result of the specified message
function.

By default, no alert is made for messages from yourself.  To change
that, customize the variable @code{jabber-muc-alert-self}.

@node Info alerts,  , MUC alerts, Customizing alerts
@subsection Info alerts

@vindex jabber-alert-info-message-function
@findex jabber-info-default-message

Info alerts are sadly underdeveloped.  The message function,
@code{jabber-alert-info-message-function}, takes two arguments,
@var{infotype} and @var{buffer}.  @var{buffer} is the buffer where
something happened, and @var{infotype} is either @code{'roster} for
roster updates, or @code{'browse} for anything that uses the browse
buffer (basically anything except chatting).

The info alert hooks take an extra argument, as could be expected.

@section XML representation

@cindex XML representation

The XML representation is the one generated by @file{xml.el} in Emacs,
namely the following.  Each tag is a list.  The first element of the
list is a symbol, the name of which is the name of the tag.  The
second element is an alist of attributes, where the keys are the
attribute names in symbol form, and the values are strings.  The
remaining elements are the tags and data contained within the tag.

For example,
@example
<foo bar='baz'>
<frobozz/>Fnord
</foo>
@end example
is represented as
@example
(foo ((bar . "baz")) (frobozz nil "") "Fnord
")
@end example

Note the empty string as the third element of the @code{frobozz}
list.  It is not present in newer (post-21.3) versions of
@file{xml.el}, but it's probably best to assume it might be there.

If you want to see what an XML tag would look like, use
@code{jabber-sexp2xml}, which takes a tag and returns a string.  You
will usually not need it in your code, as you can use
@code{jabber-send-sexp} to send away your tags to the server.

@node Roster structure, Listening for new requests, XML representation, Hacking and extending
@section Roster structure

@vindex *jabber-roster*
@vindex jabber-jid-obarray

Roster entries are contained in the list @code{*jabber-roster*}.

A roster entry is a symbol.  Its name is the JID, and it is interned
in @code{jabber-jid-obarray}.  A roster entry can have the following
properties:

@table @code
@item xml
The XML tag received from the server on roster update

@item name
The name of the roster item (just like the XML attribute)

@item subscription
The subscription state (also copied)

@item ask
The ask state (copied)

@item groups
A list of strings (possibly empty) containing all the groups the
contact is in

@item connected
Boolean, true if any resource is connected

@item show
Presence show status for highest-priority connected resource

@item status
Presence status message for highest-priority connected resource

@item resources
Alist.  Keys are strings (resource names), values are plists with
properties @code{connected}, @code{show}, @code{status} and
@code{priority}.

@end table

Incoming presence information is inserted in @code{resources}, and the
information from the resource with the highest priority is inserted in
@code{show} and @code{status} by the function
@code{jabber-prioritize-resources}.

@node Listening for new requests, Sending new requests, Roster structure, Hacking and extending
@section Listening for new requests

@findex jabber-send-iq
@findex jabber-process-iq
@findex jabber-signal-error
@vindex jabber-iq-get-xmlns-alist
@vindex jabber-iq-set-xmlns-alist

To listen for new IQ requests, add the appropriate entry in
@code{jabber-iq-get-xmlns-alist} or @code{jabber-iq-set-xmlns-alist}.
The key is the namespace of the request, and the value is a function
that takes one argument, the entire IQ stanza in list format.
@code{jabber-process-iq} reads these alists to determine which
function to call on incoming packets.

For example, the Ad-Hoc Commands module contains the following:

@example
(add-to-list 'jabber-iq-set-xmlns-alist
	     (cons "http://jabber.org/protocol/commands" 'jabber-ahc-process))
@end example

To send a response to an IQ request, use @samp{(jabber-send-iq
@var{sender} "result" @var{query} nil nil nil nil @var{id})}, where
@var{query} is the query in list format.  @code{jabber-send-iq} will
encapsulate the query in an IQ packet with the specified id.

To return an error to the Jabber entity that sent the query, use
@code{jabber-signal-error}.  The signal is caught by
@code{jabber-process-iq}, which takes care of sending the error.

@node Sending new requests, Extending service discovery, Listening for new requests, Hacking and extending
@section Sending new requests

@findex jabber-send-iq
@findex jabber-process-iq
@findex jabber-report-success
@findex jabber-process-data

To send an IQ request, use @code{jabber-send-iq}.  It will generate an
id, and create a mapping for it for use when the response comes.  The
syntax is:

@example
(jabber-send-iq @var{to} @var{type} @var{query}
                @var{success-callback} @var{success-closure}
                @var{failure-callback} @var{failure-closure})
@end example

Both callbacks take two arguments, the IQ stanza returned and the
closure item mentioned here.

Two standard callbacks are provided.  @code{jabber-report-success}
takes a string as closure item, and reports success or failure in the
echo area.  @code{jabber-process-data} prepares a browse buffer.  If
its closure argument is a function, it calls that function with point
in this browse buffer.  If it's a string, it prints that string along
with the error message in the IQ response.  If it's anything else
(e.g. @code{nil}), it just dumps the XML in the browse buffer.

Examples follow.  This is the hypothetical Jabber protocol ``frob'',
for which only success report is needed:
@example
(jabber-send-iq "someone@@somewhere.org" "set"
                '(query ((xmlns . "frob")))
                'jabber-report-success "Frobbing"
                'jabber-report-success "Frobbing")
@end example
This will print ``Frobbing succeeded'' or ``Frobbing failed: reason'',
respectively, in the echo area.

The protocol ``investigate'' needs to parse results and show them in a
browse buffer:
@example
(jabber-send-iq "someone@@somewhere.org" "get"
                '(query ((xmlns . "investigate")))
                'jabber-process-data 'jabber-process-investigate
                'jabber-process-data "Investigation failed")
@end example
Of course, the previous example could have used
@code{jabber-report-success} for the error message.  It's a matter of
UI taste.

@node Extending service discovery, Chat printers, Sending new requests, Hacking and extending
@section Service discovery

@vindex jabber-advertised-features
@vindex jabber-disco-items-nodes
@vindex jabber-disco-info-nodes
@findex jabber-my-jid-p

Your new handlers will likely want to advertise their existence
through service discovery.

To have an additional feature reported in response to disco info
requests, add a string to @code{jabber-advertised-features}.

By default, the service discovery functions reject all requests
containing a node identifier with an ``Item not found'' error.  To
make them respond, add the appropriate entries to
@code{jabber-disco-items-nodes} and @code{jabber-disco-info-nodes}.
Both variables work in the same way.  They are alists, where the keys
are the node names, and the values are lists of two items.

The first item is the data to return --- either a list or a function
taking the entire IQ stanza and returning a list, this list containing
the XML nodes to include in the @code{<query/>} node in the response.

The second item is the access control function.  An access control
function receives the JID as its only argument, and returns non-nil if
access is to be granted.  If nil is specified instead of a function,
access is always granted.  One such function is provided,
@code{jabber-my-jid-p}, which grants access for JIDs where the
username and server (not necessarily resource) are equal to those of
the user.

@cindex Body printers

Chat printers are functions that print a certain aspect of an incoming
message in a chat buffer.  Included are functions for printing subjects
(@code{jabber-chat-print-subject}), bodies
(@code{jabber-chat-print-body}, and @code{jabber:x:oob}-style URLs
(@code{jabber-chat-print-url}).  The functions in
@code{jabber-chat-printers} are called in order, with the entire
@code{<message/>} stanza as argument, and are expected to call
@code{insert} if they have anything to add.

For MUC, the functions in @code{jabber-muc-printers} are prepended to
those in @code{jabber-chat-printers}.

Body printers are a subgroup of chat printers.  They are exclusive; only
one of them applies to any given message.  The idea is that
``higher-quality'' parts of the message override pieces included for
backwards compatibility.  Included are @code{jabber-muc-print-invite}
and @code{jabber-chat-normal-body}; functions for XHTML-IM and PGP
encrypted messages may be written in the future.  The functions in
@code{jabber-body-printers} are called in order until one of them
returns non-nil.

Forms in incoming messages are not interpreted.  See each specific
protocol for whether forms are accepted in that context.

``Cancel'' messages are probably not consistently generated when they
should be.  This is partly a paradigm clash, as jabber.el doesn't use
modal dialog boxes but buffers which can easily be buried.

@code{<required/>} elements are not enforced.

The field types ``jid-single'', ``jid-multi'' and ``list-multi'' are

@section XEP-0065 (SOCKS5 Bytestreams)

XEP-0065 is supported.  Currently jabber.el cannot act as a server, not
even on on Emacsen that support server sockets (GNU Emacs 22 and up).
Therefore it relies on proxies.  Proxies have to be entered and queried
manually.

Psi's ``fast mode''
(@uref{http://delta.affinix.com/specs/stream.html}), which gives
greater flexibility with regards to NAT, is not implemented.

@section XEP-0066 (Out of Band Data)

jabber.el will display URLs sent in message stanzas qualified by
the @code{jabber:x:oob} namespace, as described in this XEP.  Sending
such URLs or doing anything with iq stanzas (using the
@code{jabber:iq:oob} namespace) is not supported.

@section XEP-0077 (In-Band Registration)

In-band registration is supported for all purposes.  That means
registering a new Jabber account, changing Jabber password, removing a
Jabber account, registering with a service, and cancelling
registration to a service.  Data forms are supported as well.  URL
redirections are not.

jabber.el will not prevent or alert a user trying to change a password
over an unencrypted connection.
