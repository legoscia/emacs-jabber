This is jabber.el 0.8, a Jabber client for Emacs.  Jabber (also known
as XMPP) is an instant messaging system; see http://www.jabber.org for
more information.

GNU Emacs
=========

jabber.el depends on GNU Emacs (21, 22, 23 works fine), in particular
xml.el, and some files from Gnus 5.10. If you don't have Gnus 5.10
(M-x gnus-version will tell), you can get sha1.el and hex-util.el
from the compat subdirectory.  (The configure script tries to detect
this situation and include the files in the build)

File hexrgb.el (http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/hexrgb.el) needed for
MUC nick coloring feature. It also placed in compat directory and used
if nessesary.

XEmacs
======

You need an XEmacs with Mule support, and recent versions of the gnus,
net-utils and mule-ucs packages.  jabber.el basically works on XEmacs,
but some features are missing (in particular mouse support).  Testing
and patches are very welcome.

SASL
====
jabber.el will use the SASL library of Emacs (from version 23) or Gnus
(from No Gnus 0.3) if it's present.  If not, it will fall back to
XEP-0077 authentication.

TLS/SSL
=======
To get an encrypted connection, the most convenient option is to use
starttls.el (from Emacs 22 or Gnus 5.10).  This requires GnuTLS (in
particular the command line tool gnutls-cli) to be installed, but
requires no configuration at all.

You can also use either tls.el (from Emacs 22 or Gnus 5.10) or ssl.el.
These are interfaces to GnuTLS and OpenSSL, respectively; use the
appropriate one.  Recent versions of tls.el support both programs,
though.  The version of ssl.el distributed with Gnus is outdated; use
the one from W3 CVS instead:
http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/w3/lisp/ssl.el?root=w3

To use the latter form of encryption, customize jabber-account-list.

Note that only the connection from you to the server is encrypted;
there is no guarantee of other connections being encrypted.

Installation
============
jabber.el can be installed using the commands:
./configure
make
make install

You can specify which emacs you want to use:
./configure EMACS=emacs-or-xemacs-21.4

You can also install jabber.el by hand.  Put all .el files somewhere
in your load-path, or have your load-path include the directory
they're in.  To install the Info documentation, copy jabber.info to
/usr/local/info and run "install-info /usr/local/info/jabber.info".

After installation by either method, add (load "jabber-autoloads") to
your .emacs file.  (If you got the code from GIT, you still need the
makefile to generate jabber-autoloads.el.)

If you are upgrading from 0.7-0.7.x, you need to update your
configuration.  See the section "Account settings" in the manual.

Special notes for GIT version
=============================
If you are running jabber.el from GIT, you need to generate the
jabber-autoloads.el file yourself.  The simplest way to do this is by
using the "./configure && make" process.

To generate the configure script, make sure that autoconf and automake
are installed and run "autoreconf -i".

Usage
=====

To connect to a Jabber server, type C-x C-j C-c (or equivalently M-x
jabber-connect-all) and enter your JID.  With prefix argument,
register a new account.  You can set your JID permanently with M-x
jabber-customize.

Your roster is displayed in a buffer called *-jabber-*.  To
disconnect, type C-x C-j C-d or M-x jabber-disconnect.

You may want to use the menu bar to execute Jabber commands.  To
enable the Jabber menu, type M-x jabber-menu.

For a less terse description, read the enclosed manual.

For bug reports, help requests and other feedback, use the trackers
and forums at the project page mentioned above.

Configuration
=============
All available configuration options are described in the manual.  This
section only serves to point out the most important ones.

To change how you are notified about incoming events, type M-x
customize-group RET jabber-alerts.

To activate logging of all chats, set jabber-history-enabled to t.  By
default, history will be saved in ~/.jabber_global_message_log; make
sure that this file has appropriate permissions.  Type M-x
customize-group RET jabber-history for more options.

By default, jabber.el will send a confirmation when messages sent to
you are delivered and displayed, and also send "contact is typing"
notifications.  To change this, type M-x customize-group RET
jabber-events, and set the three jabber-events-confirm-* variables to
nil.

File transfer
=============
This release of jabber.el contains support for file transfer.  You may
need to configure some variables to make it work; see the manual for
details.

XMPP URIs
=========
It is possible to make various web browsers pass links starting with
"xmpp:" to jabber.el.  In the ideal case, this works right after
running "make install".  Otherwise, see the manual, section "XMPP
URIs".
