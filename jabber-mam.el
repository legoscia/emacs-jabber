;;; Commentary:

;; Provides an interface to server message archives following XEP-0313 (message
;; archive management--MAM).  To use, set `jabber-history-mam' to a non-nil
;; value.  This requires server support for XEP-0313
;; (http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html) and proper configuration.  In
;; particular, the archiving behavior can be configured to select which messages
;; are stored.  User preferences can be set by server requests
;; (http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html#prefs).
